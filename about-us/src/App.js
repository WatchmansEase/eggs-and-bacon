            At the weekend these days, you'll find me at the Palestine protests shouting for a ceasefire.
            In my downtime, I like to zone out by painting, taking pictures and walking round exhibitions.

            I spend aaaaalot of time in front of a screen so I like to do something creative that doesn't involve tech. It's very peaceful and I like the "I made that" feeling you get at the end... even if I'm terrible at it 😂
